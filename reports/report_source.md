## Summary
Cardia Atlas is a local, browser-based educational prototype that estimates overall CAD and LAD, LCX, and RCA stenosis probabilities using 54 non-target clinical, examination, ECG, laboratory, and echocardiographic predictors from the UCI Extension of Z-Alizadeh Sani dataset. A FastAPI service serves four trained pipelines. The browser presents probabilities, an original interactive 3D schematic, and approximate patient-specific SHAP explanations. It is not a clinical risk calculator or diagnostic system.

## Data and target handling
The UCI workbook's primary sheet contains 303 records and 59 columns. It has no missing cells and no exact duplicate rows. `Cath` has 216 CAD and 87 Normal labels; LAD 177 Stenotic/126 Normal; LCX 119/184; RCA 114/189. The UCI definition calls CAD diameter narrowing of at least 50%, with one or more stenotic major arteries. 302 of 303 Cath labels agree with the OR of LAD/LCX/RCA labels; the supplied Cath target was retained, including the single mismatch. No record identifier is present. `Cath`, `LAD`, `LCX`, and `RCA` were excluded from every predictor matrix. Constant `Exertional CP` (303/303 N) was removed. Source spelling `Fmale` was normalized to `Female`. Other clinical, ECG, lab, and echo measurements were retained; `Region RWMA` is an echocardiographic feature, not a spatial lesion label. Numeric units are not supplied in UCI's variable table, so the form explicitly says “as recorded” instead of inventing units.

Documented feature shorthand is expanded in display labels from a published description of this dataset. Source-coded numeric values and category levels stay unchanged; where UCI metadata does not define code meanings, the interface says so rather than assigning a guessed meaning.

## Methods and evaluation
Logistic Regression, Extra Trees, and Random Forest were compared using nested repeated stratified 5-fold outer validation (two repeats), with 3-fold ROC-AUC model selection performed only within each outer training partition. Every imputer, encoder, scaler, candidate fit, and model-family choice is confined to the relevant training fold. The threshold was fixed at 0.50, without threshold tuning. The reported outer-fold metrics estimate this fold-wise model-selection procedure: in each outer fold, inner CV selects a family, that pipeline is fit on the outer training fold, and the untouched outer fold is evaluated. Separately, 5-fold ROC-AUC comparisons using all 303 records select the final deployed family, which is then refit on all records. That final refit has no independent performance estimate; the outer metrics are not a score for that particular final model. PR-AUC is average precision. Brier, 5-bin expected calibration error (ECE), and five-bin reliability are descriptive checks; no recalibration or calibration validation was performed.

| Target | Final refit family | Accuracy | Precision | Sensitivity | Specificity | F1 | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Brier | ECE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CAD | Extra Trees | 0.86 ± 0.05 | 0.92 ± 0.04 | 0.88 ± 0.06 | 0.80 ± 0.10 | 0.90 ± 0.04 | 0.92 ± 0.03 | 0.97 ± 0.01 | 0.11 ± 0.02 | 0.11 ± 0.05 |
| LAD | Random Forest | 0.77 ± 0.06 | 0.80 ± 0.07 | 0.83 ± 0.06 | 0.70 ± 0.13 | 0.81 ± 0.04 | 0.84 ± 0.05 | 0.88 ± 0.04 | 0.17 ± 0.02 | 0.12 ± 0.05 |
| LCX | Random Forest | 0.70 ± 0.07 | 0.63 ± 0.11 | 0.63 ± 0.10 | 0.75 ± 0.10 | 0.63 ± 0.08 | 0.75 ± 0.08 | 0.63 ± 0.08 | 0.21 ± 0.03 | 0.11 ± 0.04 |
| RCA | Logistic Regression | 0.65 ± 0.05 | 0.54 ± 0.06 | 0.55 ± 0.11 | 0.71 ± 0.07 | 0.54 ± 0.07 | 0.72 ± 0.06 | 0.60 ± 0.07 | 0.21 ± 0.02 | 0.12 ± 0.04 |

Values are outer-fold mean ± SD. Repeated-fold pooled confusion counts (TN, FP, FN, TP; two repeat predictions per record) were CAD 140/34/52/380, LAD 175/77/62/292, LCX 277/91/88/150, RCA 269/109/102/126. Results are internal estimates on one small cohort, with class imbalance and fold variability; no external validation or clinical threshold study was performed.

## Explanation and 3D view
The patient-specific SHAP view explains the complete deployed preprocessing-plus-model pipeline. Permutation SHAP uses a fixed 24-row background and six permutations; encoded category contributions are summed back to source inputs. Contributions are shown in positive-class probability points. For each result, baseline plus feature contributions matched the prediction in API checks (observed absolute difference 0.0000). Finite permutations and dependent clinical features limit interpretability; contributions are associations, not causes.

The app uses an original, code-generated 3D chamber-and-great-vessel illustration with schematic coronary paths. In the anterior view, LAD follows the anterior interventricular groove toward the apex; LCX follows the left atrioventricular groove (patient-left/viewer-right); RCA follows the right atrioventricular groove (patient-right/viewer-left). These broad courses were checked against NHLBI and NCBI anatomy references. The model is not patient-derived or clinician-reviewed and does not claim segment-level accuracy or anatomical variants. Users can rotate, zoom, and select vessels. Continuous probability bands are illustrative only: [0,33%), [33,67%), and [67,100%]. They do not depict measured lesion location or stenosis percentage.

## Engineering, checks, and limitations
The local stack is Python/FastAPI + scikit-learn/SHAP and plain browser JavaScript + bundled Three.js. Saved artifacts include all preprocessing/model pipelines, feature schema, data audit, experiment metrics, and source workbook. Verified: data/target audit, leakage exclusion, artifact reload equivalence, API health/schema/performance, median/mode demo contract, valid synthetic prediction, all-fields-missing inference, invalid-category HTTP 422, SHAP additivity, browser WebGL view, all four changing predictions and color bands, all four vessel selections and explanation updates, drag rotation, wheel zoom response, and reset. Continuous probability interval boundaries and cache-revalidation headers have automated checks. Six Python unit tests and JavaScript syntax and band tests pass. A 390 px viewport was inspected earlier; it was not retested after the latest illustration changes. Container build/start, cross-browser rendering, GPU-free performance across devices, independent clinical validation, and real video recording were not verified. The report is under six pages. The demo script is supplied; recording and submission are entrant actions.

This tool is educational and not for clinical care. Calibration was assessed descriptively with Brier, ECE, and five-bin reliability, but not validated or corrected. There is no external cohort, prospective study, clinician review, or claim of readiness. UCI does not state measurement units in its feature table, so app inputs display source ranges/scale rather than inferred units.
